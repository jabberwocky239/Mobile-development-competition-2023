A test task for the mobile development competition I participated in december 2022 was to create a screen for a news application based on a given description and layout. 

The task did not specify any specific technologies to use, so I applied my practices in working with UICollectionView and simplified them slightly. 

Result: I passed the qualification round reaching top 50 among ~500 participants
